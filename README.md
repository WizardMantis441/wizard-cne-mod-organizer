# Mod Organizer

Small [Codename Engine](https://codename-engine.com) addon for organizing your mod folder!

###### You can add this by using `git clone` into your addons folder!

## What does it do?
In your mod switching menu, will add a bit of text on the top right (if setup correctly, will not show if you do not have additional folders) displaying mod folders / the amount of mods in each folder.

Add a folder by adding a folder in the root directory, and start the name with `mods-`, and it will truncate in the menu.

Use the scroll wheel and left mouse to scroll between mod folders and choose respectively, and your mods list should update upon selecting.

Very human and easy to use! :)
